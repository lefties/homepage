This site has been in the back of my mind for years. How long? Well, it was registered on International Left Handers Day (August 13th) in 2016. Is three years too long to _finally_ use a domain name you purchased? Some of my other domains are inclined to disagree. ðŸ˜°

Anyhoo, the first step was to get this site launched. Whoop whoop, the hard part's out of the way. What happens next? Here's a non-exhaustive list:

- Merch! I have ideas for hats, hoodies, pins, stickers, and so on.
- A quarterly magazine (I have **zero** knowledge about this and it seems like a money pit but it'd be so _cool_).
- Resources! Fonts and desktop wallpaper would be neat.

I also want to profile lefties around the world! If you're a lefty, chances are you have an interesting story regarding your upbringing and what better place to share it than here? To start, [here's mine](/profiles/paul-anthony-webb).
